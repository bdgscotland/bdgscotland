Enterprise transformation through engineering and architecture. I help large organizations modernize how they build, operate, and reason about software — using AI agents, knowledge graphs, and platform engineering to close the gap between legacy reality and where they need to be.

Currently at **Accenture**.

## What I Work On

**AI-Powered Code Intelligence** — Autonomous agent systems that analyze, understand, and document enterprise codebases at scale. Knowledge graphs, vector search, and multi-agent orchestration turning institutional code into navigable architecture.

**Multi-Agent Orchestration** — Tooling for coordinating AI development teams. Session persistence, git worktree isolation, cost tracking, hybrid local/cloud model workflows.

**Developer Tooling** — Diagramming, MCP servers, model benchmarking, and infrastructure for making AI agents useful inside real development workflows.

## Background

Two decades of building things that ship. Started in game development — **Crackdown** won the **BAFTA for Action & Adventure** in 2006. Moved into cloud architecture and enterprise infrastructure, then into AI-powered platforms. The thread through all of it is the same: understand the system, design the architecture, build it, ship it.
